    <section class="section">
      <h2>How much does a session cost?</h2>
      <p>Session rates are listed on the <a href="https://calendly.com/jdsamford/60min" target="_blank" rel="noopener">booking page</a>. If you're not sure whether consulting is right for you, feel free to <a href="mailto:jasen@jasensamford.com">email me</a> first.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Do you offer ongoing work or just one-off sessions?</h2>
      <p>Both. Many people start with a single session to solve a specific problem. If you need ongoing support—like catalog audits, release rollouts, or team training—we can discuss a longer engagement.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What if I need to reschedule?</h2>
      <p>No problem. You can reschedule through Calendly up to 24 hours before the session. If something comes up last minute, just email me.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Can you help with sync licensing or publishing?</h2>
      <p>My focus is on distribution, royalties, and metadata—the operational side of releasing music. For publishing deals, sync representation, or legal advice, I'd recommend working with a music attorney or publisher. I can point you in the right direction.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What's your background?</h2>
      <p>I spent almost ten years at DistroKid, helping build systems that serve millions of independent artists. I've worked on everything from artist support to fraud prevention to internal tooling. You can read more on the <a href="/about/">About page</a>.</p>
