      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p>
        I help artists, labels, and music companies make sense of distribution, royalties, and metadata.
        I focus on clear systems, clean data, and practical steps you can use right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before consulting, I spent almost ten years at DistroKid, joining early and helping it grow from a startup
        into the world’s largest distributor. I built and led artist support and education, partnered with Berklee
        College of Music, KEXP, and Folk Alliance, and helped artists move from first upload to final payout.

        <li>Royalty setup, audits, and troubleshooting.</li>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Meet:</strong> focused call to gather details, links, and context.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarify:</strong> map what’s happening, what’s blocking progress, and what data is needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> short written summary with priorities and actionable next steps.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    When support is slow or not tracking the problem, I can work with contacts at distributors and DSPs
    to get the issue in front of the right team.
